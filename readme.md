# Simple NVR Container

I wanted a lightweight NVR solution to record footage from my PoE cameras 24/7. Since my smart home platform already provides the advanced features I need, I wasn’t looking for the extra complexity that comes with most full-featured NVR software.

After testing and discarding several alternatives, I discovered [simple-nvr](https://github.com/TomHumphries/simple-nvr) which turned out to be exactly what I was looking for. Credit to the original developer [TomHumphries](https://github.com/TomHumphries) for creating such a straightforward solution.

I’ve forked the project and containerised it, as running software in containers is my preferred approach on my NAS.

⚠️ Note: The original project has not been updated in several years. Use at your own risk.
