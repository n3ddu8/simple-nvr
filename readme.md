# üé• Simple NVR Container

I wanted a lightweight NVR solution to record footage from my PoE cameras 24/7. Since my smart home platform already provides the advanced features I need, I wasn‚Äôt looking for the extra complexity that comes with most full-featured NVR software.

After testing and discarding several alternatives, I discovered [simple-nvr](https://github.com/TomHumphries/simple-nvr) which turned out to be exactly what I was looking for. Credit to the original developer [TomHumphries](https://github.com/TomHumphries) for creating such a straightforward solution.

I‚Äôve forked the project and containerised it, as running software in containers is my preferred approach on my NAS.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note: The original project has not been updated in several years. Use at your own risk.** ‚ö†Ô∏è

## üöÄ Getting Started
1.  Configure storage

Copy storage.json.example to storage.json, then update the path to the directory where you want to save recordings:
```json
{
    "rootpath": "/home/username/recordings/"
}
```

2. Configure cameras

Copy cameras.json.example to cameras.json, then add the RTSP stream URL(s) for your camera(s). Repeat the block below for each additional camera:
```json
[
    {
        "name": "front-door",
        "url": "rtsp://192.168.255.255:554/1020p"
    },
    {
        "name": "back-door",
        "url": "rtsp://192.168.255.256:554/1020p"
    }
]
```

3. Build the container image

From the project directory, run:
```shell
docker build -t simple-nvr .
```

4. Start the container

Run the container with your configuration mounted:
```shell
docker run -d \
  -v $(pwd)/cameras.json:/opt/app/cameras.json:ro \
  -v $(pwd)/storage.json:/opt/app/storage.json:ro \
  -p 3000:3000 \
```
